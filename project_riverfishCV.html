    <h1>Monitoring Freshwater Aquatic Wildlife using Computer Vision</h1>
    <div class="project-detail__container">
      <p>Predictive Machine Learning (ML) models provide enormous potential applications for collecting data
        on species and engineering solutions to conservation problems. Among these potential applications is
        the detection, identification, and consequent census of aquatic species, namely invasive species.
        This project aims to develop a computer vision model for the detection and classification of
        freshwater river fish in underwater footage. A successful model could be deployed to analyze footage
        from cameras installed in dam passes, enabling automated monitoring of local aquatic fauna and
        invasive species. This project trained detection and classification models using YOLOv11,
        incorporating multiple data sources with an emphasis on handling low-quality field footage and
        recognizing invasive species such as Asian Carp. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20%
        testing. After training, models were evaluated for precision, accuracy, and various other metrics.
        Our success criteria for model accuracy and precision were set at p ≥ 0.95 for detection and p ≥ 0.9
        for classification. </p>
