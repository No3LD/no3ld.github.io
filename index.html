                <h2>Monitoring Freshwater Aquatic Wildlife using Computer Vision</h2>
                <p>With the continued rapid development and improvement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models,
                    the potential applications have grown significantly. Less explored among these fields is conservation.
                    Predictive Machine Learning (ML) models provide enormous potential applications for collecting data
                    on species and engineering solutions to conservation problems. Among these potential applications is
                    the detection, identification, and consequent census of aquatic species, namely invasive species.
                    This project aims to develop a computer vision model for the detection and classification of
                    freshwater river fish in underwater footage. A successful model could be deployed to analyze footage
                    from cameras installed in dam passes, enabling automated monitoring of local aquatic fauna and
                    invasive species. This project trained detection and classification models using YOLOv11,
                    incorporating multiple data sources with an emphasis on handling low-quality field footage and
                    recognizing invasive species such as Asian Carp. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20%
                    testing. After training, models were evaluated for precision, accuracy, and various other metrics.
                    Our success criteria for model accuracy and precision were set at p ≥ 0.95 for detection and p ≥ 0.9
                    for classification. </p>

                <h2>Codon Alignment Tool</h2>
                <p>I completed this project for a Bioinformatics class in my senior year of my undergraduate degree.
                It is an implementation of local alignment via the Smith-Waterman algorithm and global alignment via the
                    Needleman-Wunsch algorithm that translates the user given nucleotide bases in a genetic sequence
                    into its correct codon sequence before running alignment algorithms.</p>

                <p>I am a new graduate of the University of Illinois – Urbana-Champaign (May 2025) and am one of the
                    first students to graduate with UIUC’s new Computer Science + Animal Sciences program. All four
                    years of my undergraduate studies, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Isabella
                    Condotta’s Lab for the Precision Management of Animals, where I learned to apply computer vision
                    and machine learning (ML) to agriculture, livestock, and conservation. I am currently working as an
                    animal trainer while I seek full-time positions that will further develop my skills in software
                    development and ML with applications in agriculture, conservation, and biotechnology.</p>
